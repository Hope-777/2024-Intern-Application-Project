why do I want Internship?

I'm thrilled about the opportunity to secure this internship, as it aligns 
perfectly with my recent exposure to the world of natural language processing 
during a hackathon. This experience was incredibly fulfilling and reinforced my 
passion for working with data in various capacities, a passion that was ignited 
during a previous internship in data science.
Exploring LLM models during the hackathon was a novel experience for me, and I'm
proud of our team's strong performance. Looking ahead, I envision myself 
thriving within your company. In the next 2-3 years, I aim to immerse myself in 
the field, gaining valuable hands-on experience. By the 5-year mark, I aspire to
be recognized as an expert in the field.
Although I couldn't complete the entire task given due to unforeseen 
circumstances, I am committed to continual improvement and believe I can deliver
even better results with time.

Thank you
